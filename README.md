# Money_Manager

> <h3>The idea behind the project</h3>
> Make a user comfortable application to update, delete, add, and view data. The data is simply the expenses of a person. </br>

## My idea to implement this project
* Create a GUI using <code>java.Swing</code> with some look and feel features, mainly purposed to take input from the user </br>
* Store the data from the user in excel sheets, used later to plot the tables of given months into graphs axis and pie graphs. </br>
